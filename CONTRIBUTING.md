# Contributing

Thanks for helping! This repo is currently empty; when proposing changes follow these steps:

1. Open an issue describing the change (design, stack, or feature) if it's non-trivial.
2. Create a small, focused branch from `main` with a descriptive name: `feat/...`, `fix/...`.
3. Keep PRs small and easy to review. Include a short description of motivation and design decisions.
4. Include local setup instructions and test commands in the PR description.
5. Use conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).
6. Add or update `README.md` to document any conventions introduced.

If you're bootstrapping a stack, include at least one CI workflow and one passing test to demonstrate the pipeline.
